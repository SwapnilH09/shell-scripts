# this directory creates virtual hosts.....
running virtual_host.sh assumes the prior creation of vhost.conf file <br>
vhost.conf is located at /etc/apache2/sites-available/vhost.conf and <br>
provides the DocumentRoot to this website <br>

1. deploy index.html using virtual hosts
2. test deployment status
3. rollback to previous deployment(in case latest doesn't works)
